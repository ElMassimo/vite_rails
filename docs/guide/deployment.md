# Deployment üöÄ

Deploying a Rails app using _Vite Ruby_ should be straightforward.

_Vite Ruby_ hooks up a new <kbd>vite:build</kbd> task to <kbd>assets:precompile</kbd>, which will run whenever you precompile assets.

::: tip Aliased
If not using Sprockets, <kbd>vite:build</kbd> is automatically aliased to <kbd>assets:precompile</kbd>.
:::

Vite will take `RACK_ENV` and `RAILS_ENV` into account, using the appropriate configuration for
the current environment as specified in `config/vite.json`.

Check the [configuration reference] to learn more about the [build options].

## Rake Tasks ‚öôÔ∏è

The following rake tasks are available:

- <kbd>vite:build</kbd>

  Makes a production bundle with Vite using Rollup behind the scenes.

  Called automatically whenever <kbd>assets:precompile</kbd> is called.

- <kbd>vite:clean[keep,age]</kbd>

  Remove previous Vite builds.

  Called automatically whenever <kbd>assets:clean</kbd> is called.

- <kbd>vite:clobber</kbd>

  Remove the Vite build output directory.

  Called automatically whenever <kbd>assets:clobber</kbd> is called.

- <kbd>vite:info</kbd>

  Provide information on _Vite Ruby_ and related libraries.

::: tip Environment-aware

All these tasks are aware of the environment. When running them locally in
development you can provide `RACK_ENV=production` to simulate a production build.
