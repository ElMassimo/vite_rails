# Deployment üöÄ

Deploying a Rails app using _Vite Rails_ should be straightforward.

_Vite Rails_ hooks up a new <kbd>vite:build</kbd> task to <kbd>assets:precompile</kbd>, which gets run whenever you run <kbd>assets:precompile</kbd>.

::: tip Aliased
If not using Sprockets, <kbd>vite:build</kbd> is automatically aliased to <kbd>assets:precompile</kbd>.
:::

Vite will take `RAILS_ENV` into account, using the appropriate configuration for
the current environment as specified in `config/vite.json`.

::: tip Verify dependencies
When compiling assets for production on a remote server, such as a CI, it's recommended to use `yarn install --frozen-lockfile` to install packages on the remote host, and ensure that the installed packages match the `yarn.lock` file.
:::

Check the [configuration reference] to learn more about the [build options].

## Commands ‚å®Ô∏è

The following commands are available in the `vite` CLI tool, which you can run
using `bundle exec vite`, or `bin/vite` after the installation.

- <kbd>bundle exec vite install</kbd>

  Automatic setup to start using Vite Rails in your application.

- <kbd>bin/vite dev</kbd>

  Starts the Vite development server.

- <kbd>bin/vite build</kbd>

  Makes a production bundle with Vite using Rollup behind the scenes.

- <kbd>bin/vite info</kbd>

  Provide information on _Vite Ruby_ and related libraries.

::: tip Environment-aware

All these commands are aware of the environment. When running them locally in
development you can provide `RAILS_ENV=production` to simulate a production build.
:::

## Rake Tasks ‚öôÔ∏è

The following rake tasks are available:

- <kbd>vite:build</kbd>

  Makes a production bundle with Vite using Rollup behind the scenes.
